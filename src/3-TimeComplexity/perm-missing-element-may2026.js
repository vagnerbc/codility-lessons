/**
 An array A consisting of N different integers is given. The array contains integers in the range [1..(N + 1)], which means that exactly one element is missing.

Your goal is to find that missing element.

Write a function:

function solution(A);

that, given an array A, returns the value of the missing element.

For example, given array A such that:

  A[0] = 2
  A[1] = 3
  A[2] = 1
  A[3] = 5
the function should return 4, as it is the missing element.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

N is an integer within the range [0..100,000];
the elements of A are all distinct;
each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..(N + 1)].

export function solution3(A = []) {
  const size = A.length;

  const sum = ((size + 1) * (size + 2)) / 2;

  const currentSum = A.reduce((prev, curr) => prev + curr);

  return sum - currentSum;
}

// TIME COMPLEXITY O(n)
// SPACE COMPLEXITY O(n)
export const solution4 = (A = []) => {
  const size = A.length;

  for (let i = 1; i <= size + 1; i++) {
    if (A.indexOf(i) === -1) {
      return i;
    }
  }

  return null;
};
